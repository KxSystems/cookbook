SMART METER DEMO
----------------

This demo pack allows you to create an example kdb+ on-disk database containing smart meter data. 
The idea is to give you a taste of the performance of kdb+ and the q language. 
Please experiment with kdb+ and the functions provided. 
Resources are available at 

https://code.kx.com/q
 
It has been designed to run with the free 32 bit download, so care has been taken to constrain
memory usage. Better performance is possible with the licenced 64 bit version.   

There are 4 scripts:

buildsmartmeterdb.q 	: used to build an example database
smartmeterdemo.q 	: start the database and run the functions
tutorial.q 		: functions to run the tutorial (loaded by smartmeterdemo.q)
smartmeterfunctions.q 	: functions to analyze the smart meter data (loaded by smartmeterdemo.q)

There are two steps:

1. Build the database
---------------------

To build the database, run 

q buildsmartmeterdb.q

You can modify aspects of the database at the top of the buildsmartmeterdb.q script, for example
the number of days to build, the number of customers, the database directory etc.

The script will print a series of instructions and notes.  Once you are happy, build the database using

go[]

The process will exit when complete.

2. Run the demo script
----------------------

To run the demo script, use

q smartmeterdemo.q -p 5600

If you modified the database directory from the default specified in buildsmartmeter.q, then you will need
to launch the script specifying the new path e.g.

q smartmeterdemo.q /my/new/path/to/database

Again, a series of notes and instructions will be printed.  Step through the demo.
You should experiment with running the functions with different parameters (be careful of 32 bit memory limits)
and running the database with and without slaves.  Using slaves will increase the memory usage.  To start with
slaves use:

q smartmeterdemo.q -s [number of slaves] -p 5600

3. Look at the UI
-----------------

The Smart Meter Usage UI is intended as a simple example of an html5 front end talking directly to the q database.  It is not intended as a demonstration of capability in building advanced BI tools or complex GUIs.  It is to show the performance of kdb+ slicing and dicing the data in different ways directly from the raw dataset, and the q language - the whole report is done in one function, usagereport.  There is no caching of data.

The report allows for 3 things:
- filtering of the data by date, customer type and region
- grouping (aggregating) by different combinations of dimensions.  The aggregated stats are max/min/avg/total/count.  If no grouping is selected, the raw usage for every meter is displayed
- pivoting of the data by a chosen field.  If the data is pivoted then the totalusage value is displayed.

To access the UI, point your browser (Chrome or Firefox only please!) at http://localhost:5600/smartmeter.html.  If the date range becomes large, the query will take more time and memory.  Similarly, grouping by hour can increase the time taken.  It will be possible to exceed the 32bit memory limits of the free version of kdb+ when working on large datasets.
